# Obsidian File Manager

This project is for my personal use to manage my Obsidian vault. It allows me to download GitHub repositories, extract Markdown (`.md`) files into my vault, and remove unnecessary files.

Feel free to use or modify it, but please note that it was designed for my personal workflow.
